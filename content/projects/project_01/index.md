## Arkanoid

![Arkanoid Image](arkanoid.png)

Built an Arkanoid-style game using Raylib, following a tutorial as a 
foundation. Focused on modularizing C code, improving structure, and gaining a 
deeper understanding of Raylibâ€™s game lifecycle and render cycles. Implemented 
core mechanics like paddle movement, ball physics, and brick collision 
detection.

To make the game accessible on the web, I compiled it with Emscripten, 
converting the C code into WebAssembly. This allowed me to experiment with 
running native-like performance in the browser while learning about the 
nuances of WebAssembly and JavaScript interop. The project was a great 
introduction to game development, graphics programming, and optimizing C 
code for different platforms.
